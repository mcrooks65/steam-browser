# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application (Basic CLI Completed)
- [x] Pull data from an external source (CLI uses Game object with working website scraping.  Refactor for additional Scraper object in future.)
- [x] Implement both list and detail views (Simple list of Matt's favorite games is callable, can be drilled down into each one for details.)

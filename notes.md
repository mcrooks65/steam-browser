CLI Project Outline

IDEA
A CLI for browsing the Steam Store for Games.

Starts when user types Steam-Browser

Generate project with: bundle gem steam_browser

1. Plan your gem, imagine your Interface
2. Start with the project structure - google
3. Start with the entry point - the file run (CURRENTLY HERE)
4. Force that to build the CLI Interface
5. Stub out the Interface
6. Start making things real
7. Discover objects
8. TBD
